# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: OOP is a style of programming that deals in classes and objects. It's goal is to create instances of an object so that the blueprints(classes) can be reusable. 
Functional programming on the other hand is focused on the hardcoded data. The inputs and outputs are always the same.

Researched answer: OOP focuses on classes and objects specifically when coding. It is mainly used to construct reusable classes which can be used for the public interface but keeps its own internal state. 
Functional programming on the other hand is more about creating pure functions that can not be manipulated. Instead of execution it relies on declarations.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer:A float is a number that contains decimals; an integer is a whole number. 

Researched answer: A float is a number that contains decimal points. eg. 21.7, -91.09, 1000.77 etc
An integer is a number with no decimals. eg. 21, 2049,9022 etc

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: In ruby a function does not need a return. The function returns values without the need of the 'return' keyword.

Researched answer: In Ruby an implicit return is when a method doesn't have a return it will automatically return its last line.

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: A ruby block is an anonymous function, similar to a method to determine an outcome. 

Researched answer: Methods in Ruby sometimes require more code to be passed on in order to modify the outcome. These additional information take the form of a anonymous function. Blocks are defined by "do" and "end".

5. What is an instance variable in Ruby?

Your answer: There are several types of variables in Ruby, however an instance variable has content that is private and restricted to whatever the object refers to and typically starts with an @ symbol

Researched answer: Ruby has 4 types of variables and one of them is the instance variable. It is defined by the @ symbol and the content of if can only be limited to what the object is referencing.
